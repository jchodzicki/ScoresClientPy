## How to run it on Windows or MacOs
1. Download and install Docker Desktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Start Docker Desktop and make sure it works (`docker --version` in the terminal). If you want to run the terminal then
MacOs: Run `Terminal` from Applications 
Windows: Press `Windows + r`. In the Run box, type `cmd`, then click OK
3. In the terminal navigate to the folder in which this README.md file is located using the `cd` command in terminal, e.g. `cd ~/ScoresClientPy`
4. Run the next command to start docker
```shell
docker build -t scores .
```
Something like this should appear:

5. Execute the following command in terminal to enter bash script in docker container.
```shell
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/forstream:/app/src/output scores /bin/sh
```
Expected result is:
```
# 
```
6. We can now run a test to see if the script works. Use the next command in terminal

```shell
python scores_reader.py --url test --date 2023-06-23
```
Information about the games for specified date should appear. For example:
```
Game ID: 1036
Date: 23.06.2023 Start Time: 16:00
Home Team: Alpaka (ALP) - None
Away Team: Edredon (EDR) - None
Division: mixed
Game Finished: No

Game ID: 1045
Date: 23.06.2023 Start Time: 16:00
Home Team: Cziru (CZR) - 7
Away Team: Flaming (FLM) - 4
Division: mixed
Game Finished: Yes

Game ID: 1050
Date: 23.06.2023 Start Time: 16:00
Home Team: Jenot (JNT) - None
Away Team: Hihara (HHR) - None
Division: mixed
Game Finished: No

# 
```

7. A `forstream` folder will be created in the source directory where this README.md file is. 
Now we can run the command to track specific game by Id. For example:
```shell
python scores_reader.py --url test --game 1060 --start
```
Then files will start appearing as described in this README, which should be plugged into OBS.
8. To abort the script use `ctrl+c` in the terminal.
